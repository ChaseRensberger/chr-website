        I am a software engineer from the east coast of the United States. This
        site is hosted on a raspberry pi in my home office and took

            Wrote a from scratch lane detection algorithm to evaluate pitch and

            A native feeling calculator app I built for the apple vision pro. I
            can't tell you much about what it's like to use it because I don't
            own one but I am thankful to all the people who have purchased it.

          <p>
            I built most of the existing infrastructure of the HackPSU site. It
            was a ground up rebuild to make the entire site more customizable
            and make transitioning between hackathon themes easier.

          <p>
            I worked on the vehicle dynamics team. We were responsible for
            designing car decision algorithms and state machines and integrating
            those designs into the car's infrastructure. I pretty much worked on
            everything though, from the primary ROS architecture and CAN bus
            communication to completely redesigning our lane following algorithm
            the night before the competition. We placed 3/10 the year I was
            there which was up from 9/10 the year before.

          <p>
            From when I was a part of Penn State's Autonomous Vehicle Team. We
            used this to simulate various driving algorithms. Probably won't
            ever put a demo up for this because I no longer have access to the
            data.
